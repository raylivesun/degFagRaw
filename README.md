Assistant's Response:
The code snippet provided is a comment that mentions the library degFagRaw and its documentation link. To answer your question, degFagRaw is not a built-in or commonly used Dart library. It seems to be a custom library or a project specific to your codebase.

If you are looking for a library that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius, you can use the temperature package available on pub.dev. Here is an example of how to use it:
```dart
import 'package:temperature/temperature.dart';

void main() {
  var fahrenheit = Temperature.fromCelsius(100.0);
  var celsius = fahrenheit.toCelsius();

  print('100.0째C is equal to ${fahrenheit.fahrenheit}째F');
  print('100.0째F is equal to ${celsius.celsius}째C');
}
```
In this example, the temperature package is used to convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius. You can install the package by adding it to your pubspec.yaml file:
```yaml
dependencies:
  temperature: ^2.0.0
```
After adding the package, you can run flutter pub get or dart pub get to install it in your project.
